# realistic_combat
A Minecraft datapack for 1.17 JE


This pack adds 4 minor combat-realism tweaks, all of which can be toggled on or off.

1. Armor Weight. (/function realistic_combat:disable_armor_weight)
Each piece of armor reduces speed a little when it is worn, depending on the type of armor
Heavy armor: Netherite, Gold
Medium armor: Diamond, Iron
Light armor: Leather, Chainmail

Heaviest to Lightest: Chestplate, Leggings, Boots, Helmet

And gold armor, while heavy and weak, gives you extreme Knockback resistance

Also beefed up netherite armor to compensate for this loss of speed.



2. Nerf Bows and Shields (/function realistic_combat:disable_nerf_bows_and_shields)
Holding a bow decreases you armor attribute -> you take more damage from attacks while holding a bow
Holding a shield in either hand slows you down.



3. Player heads dropping upon player death (/function realistic_combat:disable_heads)


nothing to explain here



4. Combat Particles (/function realistic_combat:disable_juice)

Injured mobs leak red juice
Bugs leak yellow juice
End creatures leak purple juice
Skeletons shed white chunks
Wither skeletons shed black dust
